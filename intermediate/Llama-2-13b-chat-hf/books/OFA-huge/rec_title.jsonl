{"submission_id": "1b0vpe3", "title": "Looking for an epic fantasy-adventure series with romance (more in description).", "selftext": "Hey everyone of r/booksthatfeellikethis, I'm excited to make my first post here. \nI recently watched Napoleon and it's after giving me a craving for an epic scale story, though I would prefer an ensemble cast with fantastical elements over a more singularly focused narrative.\n\nI would enjoy a series whose kind of fantasy evokes the vibe of Skyrim, Elden Ring, Dark Souls or Berserk, with bonus points if creatures like dragons or other folkloric monsters are a part of the natural world. Anything related to Norse mythology/folklore would be great; I also appreciate fantasy settings that are not commonly seen, such as those inspired by Slavic folklore.\n\nFor the romance I would like a protector/bodyguard dynamic; I like male characters who are strong, masculine and courageous, and are loyal and affectionate with their woman. I have no preferences as to what the female MC would be like aside from being well-written and substantive in her own right.\n\nBooks I've read along this line would include Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth series, though these books are epic historical fiction as opposed to fantasy. I've read the first three books of the Witcher series and enjoyed the worldbuilding. I've read the A Song of Ice & Fire series and didn't like them beyond the first book.

Don't say anything else.\n\nRequest:\nTwo lonely souls finding comfort in each other\nIt doesn\u2019t have to have the same plot as the movies in the pictures, but you know the mood: two lonely people finding solace in each other. I know a lot of movies like that, but I realised I\u2019ve only read one book that could have that vibe? And that was just Normal People. So yeah, any recommendations?\n\nImage descriptions:\nImage 1: digital art selected for the #LoveIsLoveIsLove art show, featuring two figures embracing under a rainbow-colored sky.\nImage 2: a still from the movie \"Love Actually\" showing two characters holding hands and looking into each other's eyes.\n\n]  Sure, here are 20 book recommendations that fit the mood of two lonely souls finding comfort in each other:\n\n1. Normal People by Sally Rooney\n2. The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot D\u00edaz\n3. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot\n4. The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas\n5. The Poet X by Elizabeth Acevedo\n6. The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo by Taylor Jenkins Reid\n7. The Nightingale by Kristin Hannah\n8. The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr\n9. The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows\n10. The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry by Rachel Joyce\n11. The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson\n12. The Elegance of the Hedgehog by Muriel Barbery\n13. The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake by Aimee Bender\n14. The First Bad Man by Miranda July\n15. The Post-Birthday World by Lionel Shriver\n16. The History of Bees by Maja Lunde\n17. The Last Letter from Your Lover by Jojo Moyes\n18. The Light We Perceive by M. J. Rose\n19. The Memory of Us by Camille Di Maio\n20. The Lost Art of Keeping Secrets by Eva Rice\n\nThese books explore themes of loneliness, love, and the comfort that can be found in human connection. While they may not have the exact same plot as the movies in the pictures, they all capture the mood of two lonely souls finding solace in each other."}
