Anything related to Norse mythology/folklore would be great; I also appreciate fantasy settings that are not commonly seen, such as those inspired by Slavic folklore.\n\nFor the romance I would like a protector/bodyguard dynamic; I like male characters who are strong, masculine and courageous, and are loyal and affectionate with their woman. I have no preferences as to what the female MC would be like aside from being well-written and substantive in her own right.\n\nBooks I've read along this line would include Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth series, though these books are epic historical fiction as opposed to fantasy. I've read the first three books of the Witcher series and enjoyed the worldbuilding. I've read the A Song of Ice & Fire series and didn't like them beyond the first book.
